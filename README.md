# File Organiser

This tool can be used for organising the files and generating tree of a directory. We all have unorganised directories and the best example of that in everyone's system is "Downloads" directory. So,if you deploy this project to your system and run the command then it will work for you and give you different directory for different file types like all videos will be in one directory, all documents will be in a directory etc. and you will get a well organised directory.
